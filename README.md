Based on the test requirements, the following features have been implemented:

1.  **Product Listing:**
    *   Fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api).
    *   Displays products with their name, price, and rating.
    *   Allows filtering products by category using a dropdown.
    *   Includes search functionality.

2.  **Product Details:**

    *   The details page shows the product's name, description, price, image, and rating.
    *   Product images on the details page are zoomable for a closer look.

3.  **Shopping Cart:**
    *   Users can add products to a shopping cart directly from the product details page.
